<h2>Basic Language</h2>

	
		<h3>Java</h3>
	





  
<p><b>Java</b> is one of the most popular and widely used programming language.Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years.Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
</p>
<h4>Comparison</h4>
<p>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
<br>
<br>
When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</p>

<h3>PYTHON</h3>
<p><b>Python</b> is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and Java.</p>

<h3>C Language</h3>
<p><b>C</b> is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.</p>

<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p><b>Web Development</b> refers to a term that includes all the processes involved in developing a web project or website. It contains the various phases such as planning, designing, testing, and launching of the web project. The web development process requires a team of experts responsible for implementing the different tasks needed to create a website.</p>
<h3>HTML5</h3>
<p><b>HTML</b> stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g. HTML) languages are human readable</p>

<h2>Android Development</h2>
<p>Android is an open source operating system, based on Linux kernel and used in mobile devices like smartphones, tablets etc. Further, it was developed for smart watches and Android TV. Each of them has a specialized interface.</p>
<h3>Kotlin</h3>
<p><b>Kotlin</b> is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language developed by JetBrains, that has built world-class IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, PhpStorm, Appcode, etc. It was first introduced by JetBrains in 2011 and a new language for the JVM. Kotlin is object-oriented language, and a “better language” than Java, but still be fully interoperable with Java code.

Kotlin is sponsored by Google, announced as one of the official languages for Android Development in 2017.</p>
<h3>Flutter</h3>
<p><b>Flutter</b> is an open source framework to create high quality, high performance mobile applications across mobile operating systems - Android and iOS. It provides a simple, powerful, efficient and easy to understand SDK to write mobile application in Google’s own language, Dart. This tutorial walks through the basics of Flutter framework, installation of Flutter SDK, setting up Android Studio to develop Flutter based application, architecture of Flutter framework and developing all type of mobile applications using Flutter framework.</p>
